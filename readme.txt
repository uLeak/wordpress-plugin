== Description ==

ULeak is one of the best and most coherent cloud-based security scanner today. We aim to provide website owners the most concise security resource on the web and the best management tool for their projects.
This plugin searches the files on your website, and the posts and comments tables of your database for anything suspicious. It also examines your list of active plugins for unusual filenames.
This plugin is a scanning application that does not remove anything. It`s also just a additional feature of our regular services as website security provider especially for our WordPress users. 
Find more details in our "How does it works" section on http://www.uleak.de.

= Malware scan =

This plugin provides a malware scan to find all backdoor scripts and potential risks on your Wordpress installation. Log in to your ULeak API account to synchronize daily scanning results to your Uleak dashboard. You can find the daily synchronisation process in the Wordpress cron event schedular. We will send you also an email alert if a scanner finds an infected file.

= Leaked password validation =

This feature will check admin accounts passwords against our Leaked password repository. Our database is created on a regular basis and consists only of already cracked passwords that have been derived from public password-leaks and years of experience from working with hashcat. Furthermore we actively scan for new password leaks to include those to our collection.
Current listed passwords: 194459270

You should be most concerned if the scanner is:

* finding base64 encoded text in modified core files or the `wp-config.php` file;
* listing extra admin accounts
* or finding content in posts which you did not put there.
